# The tixforge run state file, .tixforge/<id>/state.md: creates it and reads
# or writes its header table. Sections are written by Claude with Edit; this
# script owns the header so Status and Updated never drift apart. The ticket
# is .tixforge/<id>/ticket.md and a GT id carries its issue number, so the
# header does not repeat them.

#   run-state.sh list                        "<id>\t<Status>\t<Branch>" for every run

# rewind moves the sections of the target phase and every later phase into
# .tixforge/<id>/history/<time>.md (so they are not read as approved any
# more, but can be looked up), leaves them empty in state.md, puts
# "> 巻き戻し（<time>）：<reason>" under the target section, and sets Status
# to <phase>:in-progress. Going back to implement keeps the Implementation
# Log (the commits are still there) and moves Review and PR. --keep-log
# keeps the Implementation Log too when going back further (the work goes
# on on the same branch). Prints the history file. Refuses a done or
# canceled run.

# Exit: 0 ok, 1 no such run, 2 usage or invalid value, 3 run already exists,
