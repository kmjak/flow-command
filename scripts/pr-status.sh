# Summarize a PR's state for tixforge Phase 6.
#
# Usage: pr-status.sh <pr-url | pr-number | branch>
#
# First line is the verdict (one of):
#   merged             PR is merged
#   closed             PR is closed without merge
#   conflict           has merge conflicts with the base branch
#   ci_failing         at least one check failed
#   changes_requested  a reviewer requested changes (latest review per reviewer)
#   approved           approved, all checks passed (or none), no conflicts
#   ready              not approved yet, but all checks passed (or none) and no conflicts;
#                      done for review.required: false, pending otherwise
#   pending            anything else (a draft, awaiting review, checks running,
#                      mergeability unknown)
# Following lines are key: value details. `ci: none` means no check is
# registered at all: the repository has no CI, or the checks of a PR just
# opened have not started yet; the caller tells the two apart.
#
# Precedence: merged > closed > conflict > ci_failing > changes_requested > approved > ready > pending
#
# FLOW_PR_JSON=<file> reads the `gh pr view --json` output from a file
# instead of calling gh (for tests).
