# through the implementing session's context.

#   review-input.sh <id> <base> [--since <commit>]
#
# The change is measured from the fork point of HEAD and the base. When
# origin/<base> exists and forks later than the local <base> (the local one
# is behind), origin/<base> is used, so commits other people pushed to the
# base are not counted as part of this run. A local <base> that is ahead of
# origin (unpushed merges, host: none) is used as is.
#
# Files go under <git dir>/tixforge/review/<id>/ (outside .tixforge/, which the
# reviewers must not read) and are replaced on every call:
#   diff.patch   git diff <fork point>..HEAD
#   log.txt      git log --stat <fork point>..HEAD
#   files.txt    git diff --name-status <fork point>..HEAD
#   delta.patch  git diff <commit>..HEAD (only with --since: the change since
#                the previous review round; removed otherwise)
# Prints the paths, one per line, in that order.
